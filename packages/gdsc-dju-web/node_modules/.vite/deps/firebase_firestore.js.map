Mutations can\n * create, replace, delete, and update subsets of documents.\n *\n * Mutations not only act on the value of the document but also its version.\n *\n * For local mutations (mutations that haven't been committed yet), we preserve\n * the existing version for Set and Patch mutations. For Delete mutations, we\n * reset the version to 0.\n *\n * Here's the expected transition table.\n *\n * MUTATION           APPLIED TO            RESULTS IN\n *\n * SetMutation        Document(v3)          Document(v3)\n * SetMutation        NoDocument(v3)        Document(v0)\n * SetMutation        InvalidDocument(v0)   Document(v0)\n * PatchMutation      Document(v3)          Document(v3)\n * PatchMutation      NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v3)\n * PatchMutation      InvalidDocument(v0)   UnknownDocument(v3)\n * DeleteMutation     Document(v3)          NoDocument(v0)\n * DeleteMutation     NoDocument(v3)        NoDocument(v0)\n * DeleteMutation     InvalidDocument(v0)   NoDocument(v0)\n *\n * For acknowledged mutations, we use the updateTime of the WriteResponse as\n * the resulting version for Set and Patch mutations. As deletes have no\n * explicit update time, we use the commitTime of the WriteResponse for\n * Delete mutations.\n *\n * If a mutation is acknowledged by the backend but fails the precondition check\n * locally, we transition to an `UnknownDocument` and rely on Watch to send us\n * the updated version.\n *\n * Field transforms are used only with Patch and Set Mutations. We use the\n * `updateTransforms` message to store transforms, rather than the `transforms`s\n * messages.\n *\n * ## Subclassing Notes\n *\n * Every type of mutation needs to implement its own applyToRemoteDocument() and\n * applyToLocalView() to implement the actual behavior of applying the mutation\n * to some source document (see `setMutationApplyToRemoteDocument()` for an\n * example).\n */ class Ln {}\n\n/**\n * A utility method to calculate a `Mutation` representing the overlay from the\n * final state of the document, and a `FieldMask` representing the fields that\n * are mutated by the local mutations.\n */ function Un(t, e) {\n    if (!t.hasLocalMutations || e && 0 === e.fields.length) return null;\n    // mask is null when sets or deletes are applied to the current document.\n        if (null === e) return t.isNoDocument() ? new Yn(t.key, $n.none()) : new jn(t.key, t.data, $n.none());\n    {\n        const n = t.data, s = De.empty();\n        let i = new Qt(ft.comparator);\n        for (let t of e.fields) if (!i.has(t)) {\n            let e = n.field(t);\n            // If we are deleting a nested field, we take the immediate parent as\n            // the mask used to construct the resulting mutation.\n            // Justification: Nested fields can create parent fields implicitly.

Data is stored persistently\n * across sessions.\n *\n * On Web only, the Firestore SDKs support shared access to its persistence\n * layer. This allows multiple browser tabs to read and write to IndexedDb and\n * to synchronize state even without network connectivity. Shared access is\n * currently optional and not enabled unless all clients invoke\n * `enablePersistence()` with `{synchronizeTabs:true}`.\n *\n * In multi-tab mode, if multiple clients are active at the same time, the SDK\n * will designate one client as the \u201Cprimary client\u201D. An effort is made to pick\n * a visible, network-connected and active client, and this client is\n * responsible for letting other clients know about its presence. The primary\n * client writes a unique client-generated identifier (the client ID) to\n * IndexedDb\u2019s \u201Cowner\u201D store every 4 seconds. If the primary client fails to\n * update this entry, another client can acquire the lease and take over as\n * primary.\n *\n * Some persistence operations in the SDK are designated as primary-client only\n * operations. This includes the acknowledgment of mutations and all updates of\n * remote documents. The effects of these operations are written to persistence\n * and then broadcast to other tabs via LocalStorage (see\n * `WebStorageSharedClientState`), which then refresh their state from\n * persistence.\n *\n * Similarly, the primary client listens to notifications sent by secondary\n * clients to discover persistence changes written by secondary clients, such as\n * the addition of new mutations and query targets.\n *\n * If multi-tab is not enabled and another tab already obtained the primary\n * lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a failed state and all subsequent\n * operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * Additionally, there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the\n * primary lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make\n * sure that a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the primary\n * lease). Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload\n * since it is an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the\n * lease, the leaseholder writes its client ID to a \"zombiedClient\" entry in\n * LocalStorage which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and\n * take the primary lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n *\n * TODO(b/114226234): Remove `synchronizeTabs` section when multi-tab is no\n * longer optional.\n */\nclass go {\n    constructor(\n    /**\n     * Whether to synchronize the in-memory state of multiple tabs and share\n     * access to local persistence.\n     */\n    t, e, n, s, i, r, o, u, c, \n    /**\n     * If set to true, forcefully obtains database access.

The Query Engine determines\n * what mode to use based on what data is persisted. The mode only determines\n * the runtime complexity of the query - the result set is equivalent across all\n * implementations.\n *\n * The Query engine will use indexed-based execution if a user has configured\n * any index that can be used to execute query (via `setIndexConfiguration()`).\n * Otherwise, the engine will try to optimize the query by re-using a previously\n * persisted query result. If that is not possible, the query will be executed\n * via a full collection scan.\n *\n * Index-based execution is the default when available. The query engine\n * supports partial indexed execution and merges the result from the index\n * lookup with documents that have not yet been indexed. The index evaluation\n * matches the backend's format and as such, the SDK can use indexing for all\n * queries that the backend supports.\n *\n * If no index exists, the query engine tries to take advantage of the target\n * document mapping in the TargetCache. These mappings exists for all queries\n * that have been synced with the backend at least once and allow the query\n * engine to only read documents that previously matched a query plus any\n * documents that were edited after the query was last listened to.\n *\n * There are some cases when this optimization is not guaranteed to produce\n * the same results as full collection scans. In these cases, query\n * processing falls back to full scans. These cases are:\n *\n * - Limit queries where a document that matched the query previously no longer\n *   matches the query.\n *\n * - Limit queries where a document edit may cause the document to sort below\n *   another document that is in the local cache.\n *\n * - Queries that have never been CURRENT or free of limbo documents.\n */ class Eo {\n    constructor() {\n        this.Si = !1;\n    }\n    /** Sets the document view to query against. */    initialize(t, e) {\n        this.Di = t, this.indexManager = e, this.Si = !0;\n    }\n    /** Returns all local documents matching the specified query. */    getDocumentsMatchingQuery(t, e, n, s) {\n        return this.Ci(t, e).next((i => i || this.xi(t, e, s, n))).next((n => n || this.Ni(t, e)));\n    }\n    /**\n     * Performs an indexed query that evaluates the query based on a collection's\n     * persisted index values.
